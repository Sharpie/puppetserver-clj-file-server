## [Unreleased]


## [0.2.0] - 2017-09-24
### Added

  - Regression tests which compare results generated by the Clojure
    fileserver with results generated by the original Ruby implementation.

  - Support for the X-Puppet-Version header.

  - Metadata requests now support the `source_permissions` query parameter.

### Fixed

  - Ruby compat: Metadata responses are ordered according to a breadth-first
    walk instead of a depth-first walk.

  - Metadata responses use ctime instead of creationTime as there is
    a difference between the two.

  - Ruby compat: ctime and mtime timestamps are formatted using the
    local timezone of the server instead of UTC.

  - Ruby compat: Recursive metadata responses copy attributes from the
    root directory down to child directories.

  - Ruby compat: Symlinks always use the checksum of their target
    regardless of what the links parameter is set to.

  - The `file_metadatas` API correctly handles subpaths passed to the
    `modules` mount.


## [0.1.0] - 2017-09-02
### Added

  - Clojure-based fileserver for the Puppet plugins, pluginfacts, and
    modules mountpoints providing file_content, file_metadata, and
    file_metadatas API endpoints.

  - Puppet module for deploying the Clojure fileserver to a
    Puppet Enterprise installation.
